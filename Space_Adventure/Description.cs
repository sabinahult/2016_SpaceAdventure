------------------------------------------------------------------
You've accidentally entered an abandoned spacestation scheduled for
destruction. Just your luck!

Lights are flickering, you're in a decompression room. You should
probably start looking for a podroom, where hopefully there'll be a
functioning escape pod for you!

You see a room to the north... But maybe you can find something
useful here before moving on... Just a suggestion.";

        public static readonly string ShuttleBay1 =
            @"
------------------------------------------------------------------
All of the landing docks are empty except for one ship that appears
to be in quite good shape. Unfortunately, its cockpit windows are
covered in parking tickets and there are clamps on its landing
gear. So you decide you're still better off looking for a regular
escape pod.

You see exits to the west and east.";

        public static readonly string TurboliftShaft2 =
            @"
------------------------------------------------------------------
Lots of blips and blops are coming from machines hidden in the walls.
You think you see a map of the spacestation, but there's some nasty
goo covering the monitor and even though you're supposedly cured
of your germophobia, you're not touching that stuff!

From here there seems to be north and west exits...";

        public static readonly string Hallway3 =
            @"
------------------------------------------------------------------
Why does there always have to be a maze?! Luckily this one is made
for really tiny people, so you can easily just walk over its walls
and choose any exit you'd like.

Only two to choose between, one to the east and one to the north.";

        public static readonly string MessHall4 =
            @"
------------------------------------------------------------------
Everyone seems to have left quickly as there is still food on the
tables. Looking closer at it you surmise it might once have been 
soup. 

The overthrown chairs and tables make it a bit hard to navigate, 
but it makes for a really great game of the Floor is Made of Lava.
Stop messing about and get moving!

Exits south, east and west.";

        public static readonly string Casino5 =
            @"
------------------------------------------------------------------
This space station has it all! Even a casino. Lucky for you,
there is still a halfway decent working servicebot functioning as
a croupier. You spend some time here playing with plastic chips
and always betting on black. You end up with a lot of plastic chips.

Moonwalk out the way you came in... Hint: Rimes with yeast...";

        public static readonly string Restrooms6 =
            @"
------------------------------------------------------------------
No matter how alien you are, you've got to go sometimes. And
sometimes how you've got to go can be pretty alien apparently.

There is a lot of booths and urinals here, and something you
can't really tell the purpose of. But judging from the menacing
whirring of unknown machinery coming from the inside of the cubicle
you decide to just use the restroom designed for your own species.

Please remember to wash your digits before you leave.
Don't go south.";

        public static readonly string MovieTheater7 =
            @"
------------------------------------------------------------------
When you step inside you are greeted with a monumental musical
score while the ending of an old documentary is being played on the
silver screen hanging down from one wall. It's something about
sharks with chain saws or something to that effect.

It takes you a little while to get moving. Not because you're
enthralled by the movie but rather because your feet are stuck to
the carpet. Yuck.

Shining green exit signs to the west and south.";

        public static readonly string BoxRoom8 =
            @"
------------------------------------------------------------------
In front of you is a big, blue, wooden box with some alien language
on it. If you squint it almost looks like it says ”Cops”...

Curiosity killed the cat and apparently you're at least in danger
of a flesh wound. You feel compelled to open the door into the blue
box and discovers surprisingly that it only has a little indenture
scaled to fit a small humanoid. Somehow you didn't imagine it would
be smaller on the inside.

Exits to the east and north.";

        public static readonly string Holodeck9 =
            @"
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wow! They have a holodeck! Unfortunately it doesn't work, but then
again you're in quite a hurry. On the way out you notice that the
holodeck is rather clean. As in really really clean. Somebody must
really have felt a need to scrub down everything with soap and
water, and do you smell detergent? Wonder why?

You see exit signs to the south and east.";

        public static readonly string MainBridge10 =
            @"
-------------------------------------------------------------------
There are computer monitors all over this room. Most of them do not
appear to be working. But on one screen it seems like an advanced
chess is unfolding. Another screen is showing a rather menacing eye 
that appears to follow you around the room. Quite unsettling really.

All around you are maps and coordinates scribbled on the walls
and ceiling. There's also a big red dot on the floor with the
words ”You Are Here” beside it. How could they know?

This rooms gives you the heebie-jeebies! Walk swiftly to your
chosen exit, either east, west or north.";

        public static readonly string SpaceBar11 =
            @"
-------------------------------------------------------------------
At last you found the bar. Ok, it isn't what is going to save you.
But nothing wrong with getting some alcohol down your gullet while
you take a short break from running around this miniature world
that is the ”The Glitch Space Station”.

A Würlitzer 3000 Jukebot provides an ambient soundtrack and
contains all your favourite songs. With your spirits raised you
decide to leave the bar again. Somehow the futuristic alcohol 
has already left your body without leaving a hangover.

Do the jig towards west or south.";

        public static readonly string CaptainsQuarters12 =
            @"
-------------------------------------------------------------------
There's a spectacular view of outer space from the massive windows.
Looking around you notice the bed is a mess as if someone left in a
hurry. The desk is really tidy though, and the drawers appear to be
props only. There is also a fake fireplace, but inside it lies a
real wooden log. Go figure...

There's only one way out of this room, and that's the way you came
in... because you're all out of Floo Powder.";

        public static readonly string PodRoom13 =
            @"
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ah, finally you're here. Only one pod left, naturally.
Next to the dashboard there's a card reader and instructions saying:
To activate the escape pod and leave this horrid place, please
swipe your Picard Keycard and pay 50 credits by hitting enter.";

        public static readonly string NoCredit =
            @"
Apparently you already found all the credit in this room...
Are you trying to trick me? Sneaky!";

        public static readonly string NotEnoughCredit =
            @"
Unfortunately you do not have enough credits to activate the
escape pod. Doh! I'm sure there must be some more credit lying
around the spacestation...

Exit to the west.";

        public static readonly string NoPicardKeycard =
            @"
No Picard Keycard detected. Doh! Guess you have to go look
for it...

Exit to the west.";

        public static readonly string EscapeTheStation =
            @"
Ka-ching! Thanks for your credits. Please enter the pod.
One cup of tea, Earl Grey, hot, will be waiting for you inside.
Remember to buckle up, safety first, you know!

You step into the pod and make yourself comfortable. From the
front panel a cup of steaming hot tea emerges and the calming
scent of bergamot files the tiny cabin. You suddenly feel
sleepy...real sleepy...zzz.

*** THE END ***";

        public static readonly string Quitter =
            @"
You can only get out within an escape pod...! Muuuhahahahaa!
Naaah, just kidding :)... Quitter...";
